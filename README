lycklig - image processing for lucky imaging
kinky   - the wavy image enhancer
============================================

lycklig is a software package for lucky imaging. It can align and
stack a set of images to increase signal-to-noise ratio, taking into
account image distortions caused by the atmosphere. It includes kinky,
which uses the "gaussian wavelet" decomposition technique to sharpen
the final image.

lycklig can:
    * precisely align images;
    * stack (i.e. average) aligned images;
    * deform images to compensate for atmospheric distortions;
    * sharpen images using gaussian wavelets;
    * use supersampling to increase resolution;
    * save intermediate data to avoid recomputing it later.

          arif can pre-align and filter images by quality, estimating
          the bluriness caused by the atmosphere.

Requirements and installation
=============================

lycklig core requires tclap, ImageMagick and OpenCV, which must be
version 2.4.8 or later.

The kinky program requires Python version 3.3 or later, PyQt4, the
NumPy and SciPy packages and the Wand python wrapper for ImageMagick.

lycklig is built using CMake. If you are not familiar with CMake, refer
to any tutorial. But for starters, run these commands from the lycklig
source directory:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install

You can skip the "make install" step and run lycklig from the build
directory directly, although there might be problems with localization
and icon loading for kinky's graphical interface.

lycklig is a command line utility, provide the '--help' option to
obtain usage summary. kinky is a graphical utility, but it too can be
used from command line to sharpen images without using a graphical
interface. It, too, responds to the '--help' option.
